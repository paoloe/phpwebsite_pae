        <p>Initially, before starting this assignment. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about PHP. This reflection will discuss the approach that I took to complete this assignment, the things that went well and didn&rsquo;t during the assignment. I&rsquo;ll then discuss the things I learnt both about PHP and Webmasters and how the two are closely related. Finally, it will be a reflection on my own personal experience of this assignment, I will talk about things such as the most fulfilling part of the assignment and how I see the it as a whole, and final a self-critical evaluation of the final product.</p>
            <p>The approach I took for this project was a planning based one. I first researched what a Webmaster was as this assignment was built upon their role and tasks, and why a Webmaster would need to use PHP. I wanted to learn the reasons why and how PHP would be useful to a Webmaster to give a useful tutorial.</p>
            <p>After researching the role of the Webmaster, this gave me a clear idea of the tasks that a Webmaster would carry out and their general role for websites and servers. This is when I began my research on PHP, with the background knowledge of how PHP is useful I needed to learn how to utilize it as a Webmaster.</p>
            <p>I learnt that Webmaster are heavily involved in all aspects of a website, this gave me a large scope as to what I can cover for the tutorial and demo. I also learnt and had to remember that Webmasters have varying skills and experience, I chose topics for the tutorial would be relevant to all Webmasters.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I&rsquo;ve learnt that PHP is existent in nearly all the sites today. It is a very popular, powerful and versatile server-scripting language, that should be made use of by all Webmasters or at least have experience in it. I now know that one of the most popular uses for PHP is the incorporation of it in website forms and data collection, therefor, this is one of the topics I chose to demonstrate and create a tutorial on; nearly all sites today have a registration form and or some sort of form that users fill in, I thought that this was one of the things (as well as the background tutorials) something that would be very important to a Webmaster.</p>
            <p>The most fulfilling part of the assignment is getting to know PHP, as I now know how relevant it is today in web development and management, it is a language I will continue to learn for my professional development. In terms of the assignment, creating a form that sent data to a database was one I&rsquo;m proud of as this involved numerous steps in other applications within the Brighton Domains server and the form is functional.</p>
            <p>I view the whole experience as a learning one. I&rsquo;ve learnt both about Webmasters which could be a potential future career, and I also learnt about a language that could compliment the role.</p>
            <p>The strength of the product is that it is relevant to its target audience (Webmasters) it can be utilized by Webmasters of all skill and experience levels, the topics selected were chosen based on research of general tasks of this role. A weakness of the product is firstly the aesthetics, this could have been designed better but also, I believe that there is so much more important topics that I didn&rsquo;t get the chance to discuss.</p>
            <p>Finally, the tutorial and demonstration product. I believe, that this would be a useful tool for Webmasters who want to use PHP to implement it and or just learn about it. If I were to change anything about the product it would be the aesthetics, I could have designed a better looking product; but in terms of content I understand that there are way more topics to cover but I believe I&rsquo;ve covered some of the topics most important and relevant to the role of a Webmaster.</p>
